I implemented authentication, category, an blog post.
I did not do anything about cache and did not write any test.

 1. you need to install [Laravel requirements](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/installation) 
 2. download zip file or clone from git
 3. install packages
 4. run the project
 5. test API's with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
 6. 
## Implementation points
 - Used Sqlite to store data
 - Used [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sanctum) for authentication
 - Used  [eloquent-sluggable](https://github.com/cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable) to generate slug for categories and posts
